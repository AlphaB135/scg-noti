# Testing Checklist

## Backend API Testing
- [ ] `/api/members/bulk-stats` endpoint responds successfully
- [ ] Returns real data from database (not mock data)
- [ ] Handles error cases gracefully
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for multiple members

## Frontend Integration Testing
- [ ] Team-overview page loads member data correctly
- [ ] Member cards show real statistics from API
- [ ] Clicking member card navigates to team-notification with correct teamId
- [ ] Team-notification page receives and uses teamId parameter
- [ ] Error handling works properly

## End-to-End Flow Testing
- [ ] Navigation flow: team-overview → member card click → team-notification
- [ ] Data consistency between pages
- [ ] Real vs mock data verification
- [ ] Performance optimization working (caching, loading states)

## Expected Improvements
- [ ] Faster loading of member statistics
- [ ] Real notification data instead of mock data
- [ ] Proper team context in notification management
- [ ] Smooth navigation between pages

## Issues to Watch For
- [ ] Database connection errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] API response format mismatches
- [ ] Route parameter handling
- [ ] Cache invalidation
